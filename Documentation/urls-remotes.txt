REMOTES[[REMOTES]]
------------------

The name of a remote in the Git configuration file: `$GIT_DIR/config`
can be used instead of a URL as `<repository>` argument.

Named remote in configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using linkgit:git-remote[1], linkgit:git-config[1]
or even by a manual edit to the `$GIT_DIR/config` file.  The URL of
this remote will be used to access the repository.  The refspec
of this remote will be used by default when you do
not provide a refspec on the command line.  The entry in the
config file would appear like this:

------------
	[remote "<name>"]
		url = <url>
		pushurl = <pushurl>
		push = <refspec>
		fetch = <refspec>
------------

The `<pushurl>` is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults
to `<url>`.
